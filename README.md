# lidar-processing
Processing LiDAR data for 10 study areas in northern Pennsylvania to calculate forest structure metrics.

LiDAR tiles from USGS 2018/2019, PA North. Use point clouds to calculate forest canopy height, canopy cover, and understory density (NRD). Rasters produced from script will be used as covariates in a spatially-explicit capture-recapture analysis for snowshoe hares.
